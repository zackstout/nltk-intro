# following sentdex on NLTK vids 11-15:

# we can do frequency distribution to find most common words, as well as print each instance of a word.

# we can save "features" to mark words in reviews as positive or negative

# this prepares us for (supervised) machine learning, with e.g. Naive Bayes classification.

# we can save our classifier in a pickle (so that we needn't retrain it every time.)

# NLTK actually incorporates scikit-learn! We can bring in a ton of idfferent ML algorithms (e.g. Logistic regression, SVC).

# And then we can (using an algo!) test them against each other.

# Mmm definitely check out his Machine learning tutorial (sci-kit-learn).
